 * block_visitors.php
 *
 * Controls Block Access - set in XTRA Settings Security tab.
 * This file should be named 'block_visitors.php'
 * Block Access does NOT work if this file is re-named or not found in the xtra-settings plugin folder.
 *
 * This file is intentionally empty and is just added so that you can temporarily rename it to stop Access Blocking.
 *
 * In case of accidental self-block, just rename this file temporarily until you fix the issues with the blocking conditions. 
 * Then rename it back to block_visitors.php to re-enable Access Blocking functionality.
